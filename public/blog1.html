      <p class="intro">I still remember the spark. It was a rainy afternoon in Kathmandu, and I was exploring the internet when I stumbled across a portfolio site that made me whisper to myself, "I want to build something like that one day." That moment became the beginning of a magical coding journey.</p>

      <h2>🌟 The Spark of Curiosity</h2>
      <p>I began with absolutely no idea where to start. HTML looked like alien code. CSS was just... confusing. But I loved the idea of controlling pixels on a screen. So I watched YouTube tutorials, took notes like a wizard mastering spells, and coded late into the night.</p>

      <h2>🛠 My Tools of Magic</h2>
      <ul class="tool-list">
        <li><strong>HTML5</strong> – My site's skeleton, the bones that gave it shape.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS3</strong> – The colors, the gradients, the smooth animations — the magic wand.</li>
        <li><strong>VS Code</strong> – My digital spellbook. Theme: Dracula.</li>
        <li><strong>Git & GitHub</strong> – Learning to commit like a pro and share with the world.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🎯 The Challenges I Faced</h2>
      <p>My navbar wouldn't center. My animations were jittery. I accidentally broke my entire layout at least five times. But each bug made me better. I wasn't just building a website — I was building resilience.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"You don’t need to be great to start. But you need to start to become great."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>🚀 The Launch</h2>
      <p>I finally hosted it using GitHub Pages. Hitting that deploy button felt like launching a rocket. My very own space on the internet — <strong>live</strong>, <strong>clickable</strong>, and <strong>mine</strong>.</p>

      <h2>💡 What I Learned</h2>
      <ul class="lesson-list">
        <li>The web is built by dreamers who dare to type.</li>
        <li>Everything is hard before it becomes easy.</li>
        <li>Consistency beats intensity. One hour a day can change your life.</li>
      </ul>
